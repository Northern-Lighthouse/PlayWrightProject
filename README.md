# PlayWrightProject
I created a web automation system to automatically upload my designs to a website called CafePress.

#How to use it

##Step 1 Create Folders
You need to create folder names for each type of design you've created. You can do this by running the createFolder.py script. Keep the folder names generic to fit as many of your design in as possible.

##Step 2 Run Main
Next, you want to run the main script (main.py). This will use PlayWright to open up a web browser that will log into your cafe press selling account and then start uploading your designs.

##Step 3 Delete Images (Optional)
Once your designs are uploaded, you can then delete them by running the delete.py. This will remove all of the images in a folder called processed.
